# Torcyx
    Torcyx is a extension of Cytnx Tensor network library with ML capability base on pytorch. 



# For Contributors:

    To build Torcyx, there are two dependency:
        
    * 1. pytorch
    * 2. cytnx 

    
    Step:
    
    1) install pytorch and cytnx
    2) change the -DCYTNX_PATH to the path of installed cytnx directory. 
    3) create a build folder:
        $mkdir build
        $cd build
        
    4) copy compile.sh into build folder
    5) execute compile.sh, and make
        $sh compile.sh
        $make
